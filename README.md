# Java and Groovy examples and utilities
The goal of the project is to memorize interesting things cached during my work and to provide a way-hint (one of ways) to do something.
All code was covered by tests which demonstrates application by example:
* [Groovy XSLT DSL](https://github.com/NLatyshev/samples/tree/master/groovy-xslt-dsl)
* [Removing DiffGram element in web service messages](https://github.com/NLatyshev/samples/tree/master/remove-diffgram)
